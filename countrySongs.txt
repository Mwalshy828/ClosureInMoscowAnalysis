“What Ifs”
Artist: Kane Brown feat. Lauren Alaina 
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you 
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up
You say what if I break your heart in two then what

Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl but not so fast
Before you make your mind up I gotta ask

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close, what if I leaned in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

What if the sky falls (sky falls) or the sun stops burnin'
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me), what if you liked it (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close, what if I leaned in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

Awe yeah
C'mon

You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you 
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you

Damn

What if I was made for you and you were made for me
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close, what if I leaned in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

Away (away)

What if?

“Body Like A Back Road” 
Artist: Sam Hunt 
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'mma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
(Body like a back road)
(Drivin' with my eyes closed) Got braids in her hair
(I know every curve like the back of my hand)

“When It Rains It Pours” 
Artist: Luke Combs 
Sunday morning, man, she woke up fighting mad
Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone
And then when Thursday came around, I was all alone

So I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on the radio station
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace

It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

I've been on one hell of a redneck roll for three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number 5 on the radio station
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

“Unforgettable” 
Artist: Thomas Rhett
It was the 14th of October
And that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said "yeah, right"
We were talkin' for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy
Oh, and I tried to guess your middle name
For thirty minutes bet we played that game
That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable
We were dancin', we were buzzin'
Takin' shots like it was nothin'
Did the runnin' man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down
Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn't think that it was true
That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable
Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin'
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end
That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

“Heartache on the Dance Floor”
Artist: Jon Pardi
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand, so I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye, like nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air the California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old Motown song
I couldn't say anything so I sang along
She was a heartache on the dance floor (heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, she's moving through my mind (moving through my mind)
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight, oh yeah?
So I just hung around this little west coast town
I dropped by every night, I stayed till closing time
My little mystery, that girl is killing me
So I put on a song just to sing along
She was a heartache on the dance floor (heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, she's moving through my mind (moving through my mind)
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know
You were a heartache on the dance floor (heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, you're moving through my mind (moving through my mind)
Oh, I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight, oh?

“All the Pretty Girls”
Artist: Kenny Chesney
All the pretty girls said pick me up at eight
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A.
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear
All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me all the pretty girls said
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me all the pretty girls said
All the sheriffs said kid you better slow down
All the preachers said it's the devils playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me all the pretty girls said
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me all the pretty girls said
All the seventeens said I'm getting outta dodge
All the big dreams said I'm selling all I got
All the high rollers busy placing their bets
Me, I'm heading south 'cause all the pretty girls said
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me all the pretty girls said
All of the whiskey went straight to my head
Shut up and kiss me all the pretty girls said
All the pretty girls said

“Greatest Love Story”
Artist Lanco
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker never up to no good
You were the perfect all American girl wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window everynight riding shotgun in my car
We go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen
So you went off to college and I got a job I was working that 9 to 5
Dreaming of the days when you were in my arms I've never felt so alive
I spent my days working, spent my nights drinking, howling at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back, no couldn't come to soon
Couldn't come to soon
When I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better
And I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted and you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said
I wanna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better
We could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted and your what I need
So let's meet in between
We're gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen
We're gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me

“They Don't Know”
Artist: Jason Aldean
They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah, they say what’s there to do when you ain’t got nothin’ around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say twenty-five
But those folks ain’t lived in our lives
They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything’s on the line
Ain’t just another field, just another farm
No, it’s the ground we grew up on
They think it’s a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don’t know
All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
They don’t see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don’t know a thing
About what it takes
Livin’ this way
They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything’s on the line
Ain’t just another field just another farm
No, it’s the ground we grew up on
They think it’s a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don’t know
They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah, they say what’s there to do when you ain’t got nothin’ around
They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything’s on the line
Ain’t just another field just another farm
No, it’s the ground we grew up on
They think it’s a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don’t know
No, they don’t know

“Every Little Thing” 
Artist: Carly Pearce
The scent that you left on my pillow
The sound of your heart beating with mine
The look in your eyes like a window 
The taste of your kiss soaked in wine 

Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

Guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me 
But I don't want to sleep with him no more 

Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

They say time is the only healer
God, I hope that isn't right 
'Cause right now I'd die to not remember 

Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
I'm haunted by the memories of
Every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
