Song 4
"Here's To Entropy"
Do you feel remorse for your sin?
Even though you helped make the inscription
And I saw the digits rise out of the corner of my eye
Severely out of balance against my favour
All these things are cable tied 
To insufficient time!

There's no time to tell a story
There's no time to tell a story
Afraid to reach for something new
When you've torched the curtains before their call

There's no time to tell a story
There's no time to tell a story
(Can you see this right in front of you?)
When you've torched the curtains before their call

Get well acquainted with your ache
Don't look away 
Cause and effect will be our tragic end

There's no time to tell a story
There's no time to tell a story
Afraid to reach for something new
When you've torched the curtains before their call

There's no time to tell a story
There's no time to tell a story
(Can you see this right in front of you?)
When you've torched the curtains before their call
WOAHHHHOOHH!!

You can't touch me
You're not to know,
You can't touch me
Never again!
You can't touch me
(You can't touch me)
You can't touch me!
