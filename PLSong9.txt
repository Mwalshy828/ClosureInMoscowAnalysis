Song 9
"Beckon Fire"
I came like water, and like wind I go
Is that a tavern or mirage afloat? I don't know
I guess just walk on west and beckon fire
Now life's liquor and this cup is dry
I ain't got no fight left

I came like water, bore my sins for wine
I've leaden metal into gold, it's just getting old, and I don't know why
I guess just walk on west and beckon fire
Now my mouth's getting awfully dry
I think I'll just die right here
