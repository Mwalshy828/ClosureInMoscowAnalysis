"A Night At The Spleen"
Invisible is just a word
Gotta shake off the dust and the mold
Cause I've got this feeling deep inside oh and it's moving me
Oh and it's burning me
So let's sing together

We've got honey
We've got honey dripping through our veins now baby
Sweetest we've ever been

Listen well I don't care where you've been I don't care where you're from
There's honey dripping through these veins babe
I never knew that I'd feel such a swell been so long not a care and now I know
You've all got what I need the most

As soon as we walked in this place my essence it did return
My lovely dears you all nurtured it making it so pure and I feel you so much more

Dance with me through the night we'll feel all right
We'll make it last all night
Dance with me through the night
We'll take this love and make it last all night
Last all night

Baby baby don't you know
For far too long I've been caught up in nostalgia
I almost thought the feeling was gone
Couldn't have been more wrong
It came flooding back when we all sang

We've got honey
We've got honey dripping through our veins now baby
Sweetest we've ever been

Dance with me through the night we'll feel all right
We'll make it last all night
Dance with me through the night
We'll take this love and make it last all night
When we're together it's elation I've never known
When we're together I've got so much to give
When we're together it's elation I've never known
When we're together honey I've got so much to give

Never heard you sing (troubles they are gone)
Now I'm listening
(My troubles they all fall)
Never heard you sing
Now I'm listening listening listening listening listening

Now I'm listening

Can I ever find another night that will feel this way
Can I ever find another night, another night that will feel this way

Dance with me through the night we'll feel all right
We'll make it last all night
Dance with me through the night
We'll take this love and make it last all night
When we're together it's elation I've never known
When we're together I've got so much to give
When we're together it's elation I've never known
When we're together honey I've got so much to give
