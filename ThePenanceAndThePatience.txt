Song 1 
"We Want Guarantees, Not Hunger Pains"
I’ll be a martyr for your indifference
if you promise to line my tomb with trinkets
There won’t be a resonating cry
just an awkward formal dialogue
between my ghost and those I’ve denied
We want guarantees, not hunger pains
but starvation just won’t subside

Somewhere between the penance & the patience
You drift with every word they say
Somewhere between the penance & the patience
I think we’ve lost our way

You told me what you stand for
The sleepless crusade
The bitter campaign

In every room that we walk in
the walls are skin and they’re writhing
oh they’re writhing

In every room that we walk in
the walls are skin and they’re writhing
oh they’re writhing

Somewhere between the penance & the patience
You drift with every word they say
Somewhere between the penance & the patience
I think we’ve lost our way

You’d be unwise to sate the urge
but go ahead you wouldn’t be the first

In every room that we walk in
the walls are skin and they’re writhing
oh they’re writhing

In every room that we walk in
the walls are skin and they’re writhing
oh they’re writhing

Somewhere between the penance & the patience
You drift with every word they say
Somewhere between the penance & the patience
I think we’ve lost our way

Somewhere between the penance & the patience
You drift with every word they say
Somewhere between the penance & the patience
I think we’ve lost our way

Somewhere between the penance & the patience
Somewhere between the penance & the patience

Song 2 
"Dulcinea"
Each sporadic time I see you,
I get lost in your embrace,
your embrace is just a greeting,
but I hold you none the less
It's all I have, and I'm dying for this.

Dearest Dulcinea when your heart's already full,
where does that leave all the love I have?

I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)

I'd like to hope
But I'm cut to the bone
Let confirmation die and break this engagement
Is it your fault?

I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)

To put it simply
my heart is racing unobserved
You'll never know.

As your world keeps turning
As your world keeps turning

I can see you bathed in golden light
The rays a final dawn
Touching you in ways I never could and you're exalted

I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again 

Song 3
"Breathing Underwater"
It's in the way you're moving
Why is it so unclear?
It's in the way you move and we speak in tongues
Maybe it's true what they say?
That life is never life again
Piece by piece we try to remain
All I could eat was decay
Now I'm struggling with such great expectations
I keep going through the motions
Scratching my insides and you're all showing teeth
You'll never be content
Perforations, closing eyes
We're breathing underwater
Line by line, it's not too late
We're biding time 

Song 4
"Here's To Entropy"
Do you feel remorse for your sin?
Even though you helped make the inscription
And I saw the digits rise out of the corner of my eye
Severely out of balance against my favour
All these things are cable tied 
To insufficient time!

There's no time to tell a story
There's no time to tell a story
Afraid to reach for something new
When you've torched the curtains before their call

There's no time to tell a story
There's no time to tell a story
(Can you see this right in front of you?)
When you've torched the curtains before their call

Get well acquainted with your ache
Don't look away 
Cause and effect will be our tragic end

There's no time to tell a story
There's no time to tell a story
Afraid to reach for something new
When you've torched the curtains before their call

There's no time to tell a story
There's no time to tell a story
(Can you see this right in front of you?)
When you've torched the curtains before their call
WOAHHHHOOHH!!

You can't touch me
You're not to know,
You can't touch me
Never again!
You can't touch me
(You can't touch me)
You can't touch me! 

Song 5
"Ofelia... Ofelia"
A soothing lullaby for such a precious child
And she find comfort in the melody
But every night the tyrant sharpens his incisors
And the mother lies, and the mother lies

Watching the hands
The mother's unwell
Just a vessel

Watching the ghost that came from the earth
He grants you the tome
And I can't help but feel connected

Your celluloid spirit is nothing but reels
Your innocent fable alive and it feels like
No one, no one, no one knows

Without warning
(With her eyes closed)
She haunts me
(Imaginary apparition)
And I'm breathing out in waves

The flash and the sound
the flesh by which you're bound
The wound that sustains
The sacrificial end
(A lullaby to soothe you child)
The sacrificial end
(A lullaby to soothe you child)
The sacrificial end
(A lullaby to soothe you child)
The sacrificial end

Cast away
He'll never know your name
Cast away
He'll never know your name
Your celluloid spirit is nothing but reels
Your innocent fable alive and it feels like
No one, no one, no one knows. 

Song 6
"Jewels For Eyes"
So you say you're alone!
Well I don't think so...
Yeahhh!!

And so the saying goes, "we've been expecting you"
Please tell me where do I begin?
And I would like to know if you saw me trying
Pausing, pressed and making all this scarce
Every flower will unfold
But you'd rather let them writher than to keep a vigil over them all

So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
I don't think so
And take this moment now
(No i don't)
So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
Every time, this might as well just burn

I can say with the greatest of ease that you won't be missed
Once i swore by the gods you could save me
Slow down you're not making any sense
Weren't you the one who was always right?
Kneel down and show you're penitent
Weren't you about to say you were right?
Don't remind me!

So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
I don't think so
And take this moment now
(No i don't)
So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
Every time, this might as well just burn

Well it burns
Well it burns
It burns!
Well it burns
Well it burns
It burns!

So you say...
So you say...
Every time, this might as well just burn

So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
I don't think so
And take this moment now
(No i don't)
So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
Every time, this might as well just burn

Well it burns
Well it burns
It burns!
Well it burns
Well it burns
It burns!
