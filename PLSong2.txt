"Pink Lemonade"
Heaven will burn away if you just keep on calling out its name
You seek a key you cannot forge when you are down oh so low
I got a cure so don't you worry now
Baby my recipe is gonna heal your woes
When the devil's knocking at your door, kneel and I'll pour!

How can you go wrong? You're off, this lemonade's on!
How can you be strong? When the devil's on the inside
Devil's on the outside in and you're falling

Gimme, want a little taste, this spell is breaking me down
This body's breaking, This spell's been breaking me far too long
Oh can you help me now? Oh can you help me now?
Oh good Lordy you'll never know
You'll never know just how it tears me, won't let me go
Please just let me go

I'll take the sweat from your palms, jet fuel ghosts
TV dinners with kerosene moats
Everybody's racing for that higher plane (to get down)
So they can have Christmas magic again
Wipe that sweat, slipping away, rattle the cage
Here come the jet fuel ghosts
From the time that I saw my own fuschafied dream they were coming
Kerosene moats would keep my butane in the rotten so
Can you help me darling?
Just help me

A soul like yours just clutching at straws will sip anything from them to bypass a door
And if you're drenched in fear on my pink lemon shores
You'll be knock knock knockin' forever more
So tell me now if you are, cause I'm pouring
Yeah I'm pouring and I don't fuck around

Sour patches too close to the sun
If the mirror is green in the gills
(it's on the tongue of the Brahmatron)
The nest of the wasp is at home in all four of your chambers
Fix your eggs with mortar
A phantom hatchery becomes a larder when I sense a trinity to fold
The brave, the sweet, the confidante
There's a rain of splinters to be wrung
You drank this shit now the real fun has only begun!
Even Peter didn't believe that he'd deny the son
It took the rooster to crow before them tears rolled and then he truly saw into my cup
And he thought:
"This could dissolve all my mental fences with a vote of confidence in them zona halls"

Heaven will burn away if you just keep calling out its name
You seek a key you cannot forge and you're down oh so low
(Oh no I suddenly feel automatic)
Down so low...
