"Jewels For Eyes"
So you say you're alone!
Well I don't think so...
Yeahhh!!

And so the saying goes, "we've been expecting you"
Please tell me where do I begin?
And I would like to know if you saw me trying
Pausing, pressed and making all this scarce
Every flower will unfold
But you'd rather let them writher than to keep a vigil over them all

So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
I don't think so
And take this moment now
(No i don't)
So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
Every time, this might as well just burn

I can say with the greatest of ease that you won't be missed
Once i swore by the gods you could save me
Slow down you're not making any sense
Weren't you the one who was always right?
Kneel down and show you're penitent
Weren't you about to say you were right?
Don't remind me!

So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
I don't think so
And take this moment now
(No i don't)
So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
Every time, this might as well just burn

Well it burns
Well it burns
It burns!
Well it burns
Well it burns
It burns!

So you say...
So you say...
Every time, this might as well just burn

So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
I don't think so
And take this moment now
(No i don't)
So you say you're alone?
(So you say you're alone?)
Every time, this might as well just burn

Well it burns
Well it burns
It burns!
Well it burns
Well it burns
It burns!
