Song 10 
"Happy Days"
(Check it out!)
I won뇺 let anyone have mercy until you bring me down...
Pretty little thing came up behind me
Twist and twirl, she damn near blind me
Then she smiled as she took my crown
I chased that pretty little thing all the way up the mountain
Just to see what I could see what I could see
I saw her standing by a flagpole, guess what she said to me

"You're chasing happy days, tell me are you closer now?
Look down, heaven's below! 
Praising yesterday, dreaming of them better times
You put 년m up on a throne and I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring 년m down"
(Until you bring 년m down)

When I'd all but given up, my joy became a song
Felt it in the desert air
I had it all along!

See the fool's thirst it led me up, and now I lead the devil down
My silver-lining scepter called the wind to arms, my feet don't touch the ground!
Blazing through the atmosphere on my brand new tiger-robot-wizard-shark
Truth be told I love the view up here, I should have seen it from the start

Chasing happy days, tell me are you closer now?
Look down, heaven's below! 
Praising yesterday, dreaming of them better times 
You put 년m up on a throne and I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring 년m down
(No, no, no!)
I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring 년m down

Chasing happy days, tell me are you closer now?
Look down, heaven's below! 
Praising yesterday, dreaming of them better times 
You put 년m up on a throne and I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring 년m down
(No, no, no!)
I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring 년m down

Pretty little thing, platinum sheen
I'm coming up strong, ain't fazed by the gleam
Dancing around the sun
Hard to believe I was swimming in my mind, lost in the sea
Quick fix schemes had a hold on me
Now I just smile because everything always was just the way that it should have been
Oh them happy days are here!
Feeling good, feeling fine, 'scuse me while it blows my mind!

The future is fine
My soul is elated
She's coming on home and I'm kissing the face of infinity
She's sweet and she's sour
She said to me baby she said don't let happy days just pass you by
The future is fine
My soul is elated
She's coming on home and I'm kissing the face of infinity
She's here to stay
Whispering softly
Don't let happy days just pass you by
