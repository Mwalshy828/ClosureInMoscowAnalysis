"Couldn't Let You Love Me"
Couldn't let you love me.
Couldn't let you- 

Song 11
"Had To Put It In The Soil"
Couldn't let you love me, had to put it in the soil.
Buried it and gave you to the night.
Didn't see it growing, then you wrapped me in its leaves 
just in time for us to be torn asunder.

How long can we go on with just the remnants?
Not fit to build a shelter, but I'm trying all the same.

Couldn't let you love me, now I've put that in the soil.
Buried it and mourned into the night:
"Such a beautiful heart!
Such a beautiful soul!
Lead me to your house!
Lead me to your home!"

How long can we go on with just the remnants?
Not fit to build a shelter, but I'm trying all the same.

I've lain beside you.
You've made me content.
It was always fleeting.

Couldn't let you love me, now I've put that in the soil.
Buried all the times that I was hesitant.
