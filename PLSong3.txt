"Neoprene Byzantine"
Please strut on into my future
You know the one track on my mind runs from her lips to her thighs
Oh what a libertine lady!

Little Miss Constantinople
Modified and totally fine, imperial legendary lover
Ornamental for sure
Yeah I bet that she got more heavy feminine artillery under covers
Now you see the thing is most women...
If they're smoking well she's a fire
And this saucy inferno here
(Who's got her hands full with an arms race at the moment)
Is a bona fide Byzantine empress dressed up like a tacky futurephiliac
Ooh that tacky ornamental upgrade to romance
Next level woman, paid for in gold

Please strut on into my future
You know the one track on my mind runs from her lips to her thighs
What a libertine lady! Wanna make her my Byzantine baby!
Head to toe in neoprene
I'm swimming in shark fin scenarios and they only go when I'm diving down into her brine

With that atomic attraction and a weapons-grade touch
I bet she traveled through time just so she can get her fuck on
Neon ring on her finger, silver bells on her toes
Sounds like a megaton chime, when she walks by it goes
RING-A-LING-A-DING-DONG, there you go...
Anthem to a sexual freak out!
She said: "Hey boy, I'm the kinda girl you only find in your dreams, 
and it only took four surgeries to get this neoprene! 
It's a feel like no other, salacious rubber in any color you want it to be"

Please strut on into my future
(I'm begging you now)
You know the one track on my mind runs from her lips to her thighs
What a libertine lady! Wanna make her my Byzantine baby!
Head to toe in neoprene
I'm swimming in shark fin scenarios and they only go when I'm diving down into her brine
