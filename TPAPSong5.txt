Song 5
"Ofelia... Ofelia"
A soothing lullaby for such a precious child
And she find comfort in the melody
But every night the tyrant sharpens his incisors
And the mother lies, and the mother lies

Watching the hands
The mother's unwell
Just a vessel

Watching the ghost that came from the earth
He grants you the tome
And I can't help but feel connected

Your celluloid spirit is nothing but reels
Your innocent fable alive and it feels like
No one, no one, no one knows

Without warning
(With her eyes closed)
She haunts me
(Imaginary apparition)
And I'm breathing out in waves

The flash and the sound
the flesh by which you're bound
The wound that sustains
The sacrificial end
(A lullaby to soothe you child)
The sacrificial end
(A lullaby to soothe you child)
The sacrificial end
(A lullaby to soothe you child)
The sacrificial end

Cast away
He'll never know your name
Cast away
He'll never know your name
Your celluloid spirit is nothing but reels
Your innocent fable alive and it feels like
No one, no one, no one knows.
