"Deluge"
This body is riddled with ailments (this riddled with ailments)
The devil's got me in his grip (got me in his grip)
Genuflect and skin me of this payment (and skin me of this payment)
We share the same affliction everybody's gotta breathe
That's what I say

I thought your touch would be the vessel to my salvation
But it drifted far beyond the shore
So I put up my sails and I searched all my days and I found out one thing
There's no love anymore

No more pouring out I swear to god I'll overflow
Until it spills over your floor's ungratified

It comes in oceanic surges (oceanic surges)
I heard they purged you of denial (I heard they purged you of denial)
But I'm lost in a sea of delusion (lost sea of delusion)
So instead I purge my abdomen of antiquated doubt

Your candle's burning to no end burning to no end
But you're relentless all the same
Please dear just validate this fixation
Oh please dear just validate this fixation

No more pouring out I swear to god I'll overflow
Until it spills over your floor's ungratified

This body is riddled with ailments
The devil's got me in his grip
This body is riddled with ailments
The devil's got me in his grip

This body is riddled with ailments
The devil's got me
We share the same affliction everybody's gotta breathe
Burning to no end

No more pouring out I swear to god I'll overflow
My own deluge going to waste It leaves me restless but I will wait
Until it spills over your floor's ungratified
Your floor's ungratified
