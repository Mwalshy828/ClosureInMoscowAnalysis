Song 2
"Dulcinea"
Each sporadic time I see you,
I get lost in your embrace,
your embrace is just a greeting,
but I hold you none the less
It's all I have, and I'm dying for this.

Dearest Dulcinea when your heart's already full,
where does that leave all the love I have?

I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)

I'd like to hope
But I'm cut to the bone
Let confirmation die and break this engagement
Is it your fault?

I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)

To put it simply
my heart is racing unobserved
You'll never know.

As your world keeps turning
As your world keeps turning

I can see you bathed in golden light
The rays a final dawn
Touching you in ways I never could and you're exalted

I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
(I'm starving for you, but you will never know)
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
I still see your face, you're safe in my sleep again
