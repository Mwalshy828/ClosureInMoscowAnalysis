"That Brahmatron Song"
I was born on the precipice
Born into retrograde
In the bleak distant future of my mind is orbital decay
I was born a son of famine
Born into the knee of the curve
Caught in a grip so foreign, that I'm wonderin' if it's a phantom Earth

Now I'm livin' in a toxic nightmare warhead ball
(Hanging by two-thirds of a thread)
One hand hovers over it with nail scissors
(That is all it takes)
Baby please don't listen out for sacred octaves
'Cause if it falls, it falls on deaf ears
And all you will feel is a white-hot mess

I wouldn't say it's a god's kinda music, that we can listen to
It's that Brahmatron song
You know we've been singin' it all along
Not a god's kinda music
I wanna dance around the pit of the truth
Singin' Brahmatrons song
Just another level gone

This is the year of the reboot, the sequel
The satellite dish is servin' up 12 kinds of evil
Year of the television fizz turnin' me off
Well it don't add up, guess I gotta do some math again
See if the bull has reigns
Cause in the bleak distant future of my mind, lambs reach killing weight
Oh the sounds they make

I wouldn't say it's a god's kinda music, that we can listen to
It's that Brahmatron song
You know we've been singin' it all along
Not a god's kinda music
I wanna dance around the pit of the truth
Singin' Brahmatrons song
Just another level gone

Baby tell me what you hear down there
Even silence whispers cold, ringing out between the words

I wouldn't say it's a god's kinda music, that we can listen to
It's that Brahmatron song
You know we've been singin' it all along
Not a god's kinda music
I wanna dance around the pit of the truth
Singin' Brahmatrons song
Just another level gone, it's gone

Now if the void starts flickerin'
We gotta show just a little bit of grace
There ain't no power, savin' our souls now

Brahmatron yawns at you. (Na na na na na na na)
Brahmatron yawns at me, too

Plenty of drugs,
Dominion over animals,
Children of dogs, and skin deep cannibals
Sip from the font, lap it up! You're just rugs!
Taste the placenta of Miss Nightingale
While she sutures the signs of attack!
It's the new zodiac! Say it now, the new zodiac!

Brahmatron yawns at you. (Na na na na na na na)
Brahmatron yawns at me, too

Sounds of alarm, reverberating strange;
Equilateral, bisexual triangles intersecting at parallel planes!
They struck chords in serpent circles, echoed through the age!
It's the new zodiac! You heard me, the new zodiac!
