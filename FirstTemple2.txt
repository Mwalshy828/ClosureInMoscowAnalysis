Song 1
"Kissing Cousins"
We have never lived we have never even tried
Come on now give that burden to me
We have never lived
We're just creeping all our days
And you could feast age
Feast and still feel famine all the same
When this food's an orgasm dripping context down my drains

We've had our chances
We didn't see them through

It never ends (never ends never ends)
Carry on the sin
It never ends it never ends
We can never rest
It's like kissing cousins It's like breaking bread

It gets me so frustrated
Everyone's an expert I'm so sick of it
Makes me want to gouge a thousand eyes
Cho cho choke five hundred throats
Feed them to the fishes
Swimming in swimming in swimming in my moat
While I sit in my castle (perched all alone)
Disconnected on a sullen throne

It never ends (never ends never ends)
Carry on the sin
It never ends it never ends
We can never rest
It's like kissing cousins It's like breaking bread

Sing it
Born of detriment
Come on sing it
Born of all the ills that lead us in

They're not stopping
It never ends so forever they roam

While I sit in my castle (perched all alone)
Disconnected on a sullen throne

We have never lived
We have never even tried
No we have never lived
We have never even tried

Come on now give that burden to me

It never ends (never ends never ends)
Carry on the sin
It never ends it never ends
We can never rest
It's like kissing cousins It's like breaking bread

Sing it
Born of detriment
Come on sing it
Born of all the ills that lead us in 

Song 2
"Reindeer Age"
Fostering all my millstones.
Bearing the fruit of embellishment.

I'm seeing their false perception with my true perception,
and he's my canary in their mine.
I was gonna tell everyone,
but you forced through, you left through the eye of the sun.
I was gonna tell everyone. You're are such a clever devil.

I felt space and time vibrate.
I've seen a glimpse;
A tracing overlapped emits the evidence.
So how do I transcend?
The hinges on this door are much too heavy for my unanointed hands.

I've got to fornicate with these severed ties.
So long as there is no disease your prostitute has had.
She's sleeping in the steeple so to keep the penitent beds.
Fostering all my milestones. (Like she'd shrug off with the shore.)
Bearing the fruit of embellishment. (I've got to take it from her.)

I felt space and time vibrate.
I've seen a glimpse;
A tracing overlapped emits the evidence.
So how do I transcend?
The hinges on this door are much too heavy for my unanointed hands.

Pretty queen of my intrusion was about to yell.
Forty thousand years of drippings-
Pretty queen of my intrusion was about to yell.
Forty thousand years of drippings, and her eyes did swell.

I felt space and time vibrate.
I've seen a glimpse;
A tracing overlapped emits the evidence.
So how do I transcend?
The hinges on this door are much too heavy for my unanointed hands. 

Song 3
"Sweet#hart"
I lay awake stuck by this fickle thorn
I lay with you so they won't sink in their claws
I lay awake while the beasts and the whores are
Dancing in dancing in
Dancing in the jaws jaws jaws of a landfill

Am I ever gonna let you in before I see it coming systematic in decay

I'm dying to feel what you feel now
You've already been such a sweetheart
And I know we all get scared
We all get scared

Too much head too little heart oh honey
I want your touch such a shame that I am numb honey
Too much head too little heart oh honey
Not meant to be this way

Lover lover lover you'll never know
You'll never know because
Lover lover breathing down my neck
Incendiary breath and still my lover is a burden
Tell me something could you smell my fear
As I lay there cringing on your bed

I'm dying to feel what you feel now
You've already been such a sweetheart
And I know we all get scared
We all get scared

Too much head too little heart oh honey
I want your touch such a shame that I am numb honey
Too much head too little heart oh honey
Not meant to be this way

Maybe my seed found purchase in your soil
It's just a fight a futile fight to feel connected
I lay awake stuck by this fickle thorn
Instead of tending to it's prick I lay infected

Am I ever gonna let you in before I see it coming systematic in decay

I'm dying to feel what you feel now
You've already been such a sweetheart
And I know we all get scared
We all get scared

Too much head too little heart oh honey
I want your touch such a shame that I am numb honey
Too much head too little heart oh honey
As I lay there cringing on your bed

Too much head too little heart oh honey
Not meant to be this way 

Song 4
"Vanguard"
My curse is alphabetic. Dianetic-Crucifix.
Your curse is post-magnetic, now they suckle from your drip.
Their curse is so pathetic, they're the real heretics.
Our curse is not kinetic if they couldn't break our grip.

Foetid leeches sap their glands of inquisition.
They need blinding sustenance.

Don't you dare speak that name.
Don't you ever speak that name.
Break the very tenets that you spit in my face, now I'm ready to obliterate.
So send me all your preachers, and I'll put them all to shame.
I'll be the vanguard of their fall, middle of their falter.
Bezel in their rings now dropping all the stones.

This serpent on my doorstep, well, he's got a sweet southern drawl.
Lulling so you may invite his venom.
Oh, he was knocking, but didn't know it's coming.
Oh, he was knocking, but didn't know my mutation was imminent.

He couldn't help it; spouting invocations.
I said unto him:

Don't you dare speak that name.
Don't you ever speak that name.
Break the very tenets that you spit in my face, now I'm ready to obliterate.
So send me all your preachers, and I'll put them all to shame.
I'll be the vanguard of their fall, middle of their falter.
Bezel in their rings, now dropping all the stones.
First you'll oscillate, and then you'll feel the fire burn and formicate, 
while all your words are coming out cancrine.

Don't just let him rot this hall.
"I couldn't do that even if I wanted to."
Don't just let him rot this hall
"I couldn't do that even if I wanted to be saved."
Then you'll all fall in silence.
Then you'll all fall.

And I will tell you all, as I said to your serpent:
Don't you dare speak that name.
Don't you ever speak that name.
Break the very tenets that you spit in my face, now I'm ready to obliterate.
So send me all your preachers, and I'll put them all to shame.
I'll be the vanguard of their fall, middle of their falter.
Bezel in their rings, now dropping all the stones.
First you'll oscillate, and then you'll feel the fire burn and formicate, 
while all your words are coming out cancrine. 

Song 5
"A Night At The Spleen"
Invisible is just a word
Gotta shake off the dust and the mold
Cause I've got this feeling deep inside oh and it's moving me
Oh and it's burning me
So let's sing together

We've got honey
We've got honey dripping through our veins now baby
Sweetest we've ever been

Listen well I don't care where you've been I don't care where you're from
There's honey dripping through these veins babe
I never knew that I'd feel such a swell been so long not a care and now I know
You've all got what I need the most

As soon as we walked in this place my essence it did return
My lovely dears you all nurtured it making it so pure and I feel you so much more

Dance with me through the night we'll feel all right
We'll make it last all night
Dance with me through the night
We'll take this love and make it last all night
Last all night

Baby baby don't you know
For far too long I've been caught up in nostalgia
I almost thought the feeling was gone
Couldn't have been more wrong
It came flooding back when we all sang

We've got honey
We've got honey dripping through our veins now baby
Sweetest we've ever been

Dance with me through the night we'll feel all right
We'll make it last all night
Dance with me through the night
We'll take this love and make it last all night
When we're together it's elation I've never known
When we're together I've got so much to give
When we're together it's elation I've never known
When we're together honey I've got so much to give

Never heard you sing (troubles they are gone)
Now I'm listening
(My troubles they all fall)
Never heard you sing
Now I'm listening listening listening listening listening

Now I'm listening

Can I ever find another night that will feel this way
Can I ever find another night, another night that will feel this way

Dance with me through the night we'll feel all right
We'll make it last all night
Dance with me through the night
We'll take this love and make it last all night
When we're together it's elation I've never known
When we're together I've got so much to give
When we're together it's elation I've never known
When we're together honey I've got so much to give 

Song 6
"I'm A Ghost Of Twilight"
Awake to the cracking of bones; to the scratch in my throat.
Awake to every boy and girl, every heart that feels a swell.

It's all so lovely, when you look at it just right.
It's also stabbing me to sleep-
Needles long into the night.
Suspended eventide can only mean one thing:

I'm a ghost of twilight, haunting neither night nor day.
With one foot treading sweet rapture, and one foot in the grave.

Asleep to the creaks and the groans; to the sounds of their sex.
Asleep to all the promises, all the blessed days ahead.
I want so much to keep this precious thing from harm.
Then there's a part of me that wants to hold it lifeless in my arms.

Because I got this chill in my bones, and a warmth on my face.

I'm a ghost of twilight, haunting neither night nor day.
With one foot treading sweet rapture, and one foot in the grave.

Desperate for resolve, they're closer every day.
The ghosts of twilight call, so now I'm joining them.

I slept with faith, and found a corpse in my arms on awakening.
I drank and danced all night with doubt, and found her a virgin in the morning. 

Song 7
"Permafrost"
Now the time has come:
Take my icy lungs away.
Pull the teeth from my skull.
Sheer my crown of its hair.
The permafrost is near, but you won't let it take me.
It came for me alone, but my gift of flesh will save me.

Song 8
"Deluge"
This body is riddled with ailments (this riddled with ailments)
The devil's got me in his grip (got me in his grip)
Genuflect and skin me of this payment (and skin me of this payment)
We share the same affliction everybody's gotta breathe
That's what I say

I thought your touch would be the vessel to my salvation
But it drifted far beyond the shore
So I put up my sails and I searched all my days and I found out one thing
There's no love anymore

No more pouring out I swear to god I'll overflow
Until it spills over your floor's ungratified

It comes in oceanic surges (oceanic surges)
I heard they purged you of denial (I heard they purged you of denial)
But I'm lost in a sea of delusion (lost sea of delusion)
So instead I purge my abdomen of antiquated doubt

Your candle's burning to no end burning to no end
But you're relentless all the same
Please dear just validate this fixation
Oh please dear just validate this fixation

No more pouring out I swear to god I'll overflow
Until it spills over your floor's ungratified

This body is riddled with ailments
The devil's got me in his grip
This body is riddled with ailments
The devil's got me in his grip

This body is riddled with ailments
The devil's got me
We share the same affliction everybody's gotta breathe
Burning to no end

No more pouring out I swear to god I'll overflow
My own deluge going to waste It leaves me restless but I will wait
Until it spills over your floor's ungratified
Your floor's ungratified 

Song 9
"Afterbirth"
Make me vent at the knees.
I've got a phantom lung- Better than the other.
More like the broach you wore with apocryphal insignia.
It was better left untouched.
It was better left alone, for the hour of my echo is at hand.

Do you feel that respiration?
It's blocking out the sky.
Now there's no light to be shed on this painful labor.

Walking with my old limp that resonates your ego,
when i feel the resignation of my limbs.
You rode in on a horse, but wouldn't form a tryst.
Saw you ride in on a horse, but you couldn't be convinced.

Tell your brother's keeper that he's in an awful mess.
Tell your zealous mother to spay her tongue.
Tell your brother's keeper, his cuts are somewhat of a nuance 
when that zealous mother bleeds for everyone

Now you feel that respiration?
It's blocking out the sky, leaving no light to be shed on this painful labor.

"Arecibo Message"
My earthly womb in your monolith:
You've got it sewn, bunching at my hips. [x4]

I ventured to your city, to meet you at your throne.
I'm stuck inside your vestibule with no way to atone.

I gnashed my vexing jowl at the suffragette crown.
The temple steps above my cringe.
The temple steps beneath my scowl.
And what's the use of pleading thirst?
I see you drinking from my cup.

You're not the flesh I was after, so I try scraping off the blight.
Can't get no passage to my terminus when I'm dying every night.
So don't perspire with excitement.
In fact, don't perspire at all.
The jewel of my retribution makes empires rise and fall.

How could you defy these precious little ones?
The very ones that show you love.
I know you've got that filament, so how could you defy these precious little ones?

Somethings got a hold on me.
About to breach the seal.

You're not the flesh I was after, so I try scraping off the blight.
Can't get no passage to my terminus when I'm dying every night.
So don't perspire with excitement.
In fact, don't perspire at all.

If the drones become enlightened, you'll have such a noble swarm...

Song 10
"Couldn't Let You Love Me"
Couldn't let you love me.
Couldn't let you- 

Song 11
"Had To Put It In The Soil"
Couldn't let you love me, had to put it in the soil.
Buried it and gave you to the night.
Didn't see it growing, then you wrapped me in its leaves 
just in time for us to be torn asunder.

How long can we go on with just the remnants?
Not fit to build a shelter, but I'm trying all the same.

Couldn't let you love me, now I've put that in the soil.
Buried it and mourned into the night:
"Such a beautiful heart!
Such a beautiful soul!
Lead me to your house!
Lead me to your home!"

How long can we go on with just the remnants?
Not fit to build a shelter, but I'm trying all the same.

I've lain beside you.
You've made me content.
It was always fleeting.

Couldn't let you love me, now I've put that in the soil.
Buried all the times that I was hesitant.
