"Reindeer Age"
Fostering all my millstones.
Bearing the fruit of embellishment.

I'm seeing their false perception with my true perception,
and he's my canary in their mine.
I was gonna tell everyone,
but you forced through, you left through the eye of the sun.
I was gonna tell everyone. You're are such a clever devil.

I felt space and time vibrate.
I've seen a glimpse;
A tracing overlapped emits the evidence.
So how do I transcend?
The hinges on this door are much too heavy for my unanointed hands.

I've got to fornicate with these severed ties.
So long as there is no disease your prostitute has had.
She's sleeping in the steeple so to keep the penitent beds.
Fostering all my milestones. (Like she'd shrug off with the shore.)
Bearing the fruit of embellishment. (I've got to take it from her.)

I felt space and time vibrate.
I've seen a glimpse;
A tracing overlapped emits the evidence.
So how do I transcend?
The hinges on this door are much too heavy for my unanointed hands.

Pretty queen of my intrusion was about to yell.
Forty thousand years of drippings-
Pretty queen of my intrusion was about to yell.
Forty thousand years of drippings, and her eyes did swell.

I felt space and time vibrate.
I've seen a glimpse;
A tracing overlapped emits the evidence.
So how do I transcend?
The hinges on this door are much too heavy for my unanointed hands.
