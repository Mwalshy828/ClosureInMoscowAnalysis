"Sweet#hart"
I lay awake stuck by this fickle thorn
I lay with you so they won't sink in their claws
I lay awake while the beasts and the whores are
Dancing in dancing in
Dancing in the jaws jaws jaws of a landfill

Am I ever gonna let you in before I see it coming systematic in decay

I'm dying to feel what you feel now
You've already been such a sweetheart
And I know we all get scared
We all get scared

Too much head too little heart oh honey
I want your touch such a shame that I am numb honey
Too much head too little heart oh honey
Not meant to be this way

Lover lover lover you'll never know
You'll never know because
Lover lover breathing down my neck
Incendiary breath and still my lover is a burden
Tell me something could you smell my fear
As I lay there cringing on your bed

I'm dying to feel what you feel now
You've already been such a sweetheart
And I know we all get scared
We all get scared

Too much head too little heart oh honey
I want your touch such a shame that I am numb honey
Too much head too little heart oh honey
Not meant to be this way

Maybe my seed found purchase in your soil
It's just a fight a futile fight to feel connected
I lay awake stuck by this fickle thorn
Instead of tending to it's prick I lay infected

Am I ever gonna let you in before I see it coming systematic in decay

I'm dying to feel what you feel now
You've already been such a sweetheart
And I know we all get scared
We all get scared

Too much head too little heart oh honey
I want your touch such a shame that I am numb honey
Too much head too little heart oh honey
As I lay there cringing on your bed

Too much head too little heart oh honey
Not meant to be this way
