"Kissing Cousins"
We have never lived we have never even tried
Come on now give that burden to me
We have never lived
We're just creeping all our days
And you could feast age
Feast and still feel famine all the same
When this food's an orgasm dripping context down my drains

We've had our chances
We didn't see them through

It never ends (never ends never ends)
Carry on the sin
It never ends it never ends
We can never rest
It's like kissing cousins It's like breaking bread

It gets me so frustrated
Everyone's an expert I'm so sick of it
Makes me want to gouge a thousand eyes
Cho cho choke five hundred throats
Feed them to the fishes
Swimming in swimming in swimming in my moat
While I sit in my castle (perched all alone)
Disconnected on a sullen throne

It never ends (never ends never ends)
Carry on the sin
It never ends it never ends
We can never rest
It's like kissing cousins It's like breaking bread

Sing it
Born of detriment
Come on sing it
Born of all the ills that lead us in

They're not stopping
It never ends so forever they roam

While I sit in my castle (perched all alone)
Disconnected on a sullen throne

We have never lived
We have never even tried
No we have never lived
We have never even tried

Come on now give that burden to me

It never ends (never ends never ends)
Carry on the sin
It never ends it never ends
We can never rest
It's like kissing cousins It's like breaking bread

Sing it
Born of detriment
Come on sing it
Born of all the ills that lead us in
