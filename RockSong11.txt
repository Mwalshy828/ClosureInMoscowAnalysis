Live In The Moment
Portugal. The Man
My home
Is a girl with eyes like wishing wells
I'm not alone
But I'm still lone, lonely
When I was young
Always go below the midnight sun
Those days are done
But I'm still glowing
Ooh la la la la la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning
A lie, oh well
When you're gone
Goodbye, so long, farewell
Ooh la la la la la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning
With that soul to sell
When you're gone
Goodbye, so long, farewell
My home
Is a girl who can't wait for time to tell
God only knows
We don't need history
When your family
Swinging from the branches of a tree
God only knows
We don't need ghost stories
Ooh la la la la la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning
A lie, oh well
When you're gone
Goodbye, so long, farewell
Ooh la la la la la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning
With that soul to sell
When you're gone
Goodbye, so long, farewell
Ooh I can't believe it
Nothing's gonna comfort me now
Ooh I can't believe it
Nothing's gonna comfort me now
Ooh la la la la la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning
A lie, oh well
When you're gone
Goodbye, so long, farewell
Ooh la la la la la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning
With that soul to sell
When you're gone
Goodbye, so long, farewell
Oh my god I can’t believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know
Come and watch the garden grow
I’ll see you when you get there
Oh my god I can’t believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know
Come and watch the garden grow
I’ll see you when you get there
I’ll see you when you get there
I’ll see you when you get there
